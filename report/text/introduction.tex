Yet Another Programming Language, later on referred to as YAPL, is created with the purpose to gain a better understanding of translators and programming languages. 
\paragraph{•}
In this report we will explain in detail how YAPL is built and works. We will dive into the syntax, semantic and contextual constraints of the language.
\paragraph{•}
We will dive into the way the compiler was written for YAPL. This is done with the help of ANTLR4. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees. The tree is then walked and YAPL code is then translated to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
\paragraph{•}
Last but not least, there are some tests. The tests use all the functionality of YAPL and shows correct and incorrect statements. The tests contains syntactical errors as well as semantically run-time errors.
