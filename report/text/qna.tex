During the development of this language we ran into some problems. This problems were not always trivial and we will describe here the problem and the solution. Hopefully this can help you to understand certain decisions and help you when you develop your own language or extend our language.
\section{ANTRL4 and ll(1)}
In ANTLR3 it was very simple to check if your language was ll(1), in the options you set k to 1. If the language would need to have a look-ahead of more then 1 ANTLR3 would give an error. ANTLR4 however does not have this option anymore. \\
A solution could be to check if the function $adaptivePredict$ exists in the java source. Another option is to copy paste the ANTLR4 grammar into ANTLR3 and set the option $k=1$. The ANTLR4 grammar is almost equal to ANTLR3 except for some minor things like the options and trimming the whitespace.
